        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p><b class="S">S</b>trawberries are sweet supple red fruits with surfaces that are seed-
        studded. They come from a low-growing plant belonging to genus
        Fragaria of the rose (Rosaceae) family, enclosing white flowers, lobed
        foliage, and runners. They originate all through the north temperate zones.</p>
        <p>They are the most famous and trendiest fruits in the planet (Roger). There
        are over 600 assortments of strawberries that vary in taste, size, and feel;
        all which have similiar trait; heart silhouette, red fleshy tissue with yelloe
        seeds shooting the surface, petite,  royal, leafy green lids, and stalk terlihat
        embellish their crowns (WHFoods). Below is picture of the strawberry fruit.</p>

        <h2 id="dh">Detailed History</h2>
        <p>The word strawberry is coined from 'strewn' berries about the plants and 
        thus the "strewn berry" finally turned into "Strawberry" (Roger). They are 
        not actual fruits or berries but distended ends of the stamen of the plant.
        The seeds are on the external surface, rather than the internal berry. There 
        are around 200 seeds for each berry. They are low in calories and are 
        non-fat, loaded with vitamin c, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B6 and potassium 
        (Roger).</p>
        <p>Over the years they have been utilized as medications for ailments like, 
        stained teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopley,9). Strawberries 
        were served up at medieval state occasions as a show of peace, wealth, 
        and excellence. The most well-known communal intake of strawberries is 
        at Wimbledon annually, when strawberries and cream are eaten by very 
        well attired Englishmen in the middle of tennis games (Hopley,9).</p>

        <h2 id="vus">Various Uses Of Strawberries</h2>
        <p>Strawberries have numerous uses. One of the most famous uses of 
        strawberries is being used as recipe or an ingredient in preparation of 
        drinks, meals or snacks. Strawberries are used as ingredients in many 
        types of food like cakes, yoghurt, desserts, salads, juice, meals and 
        chocolates.</p>
